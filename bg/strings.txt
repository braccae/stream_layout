"I cannot be caged. I cannot be controlled. Understand this as you die, ever pathetic, ever fools!"
"Life... is strength. This is not to be contested; it seems logical enough. You live; you affect your world. But is it what you want?"
"I will be the last... and you will go first."
"Face me! Face the new Lord of Murder!"
"You must gather your party before venturing forth."
"The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sown from their passage."

"Go for the eyes, Boo! GO FOR THE EYES! RrraaaAAGH!"
"Butt-kicking for goodness!"
"Evil, meet my sword! SWORD, MEET EVIL!"
"Live by the sword, live a good long time!"
"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, watch it! I'm huge!"

"Evil around every corner. Careful not to step in any."

"What about now? What about now? What about now?"

"Yes, oh omnipresent authority figure?"
"What now? Need your pantaloons pressed?!"
"Careful. Ground tongue makes excellent fertilizer, especially with what you're spewing."
"You are amusing, in a 'what the hell is wrong with you' kind of way."
"If a tree falls in the forest... I'll kill the bastard what done it!"
"I can mend your wounds, if I must. What—you want me to kiss your knee and make it better?"
"Is grass not made of blades? Do stars not shoot? Nature be well-armed, and demands so of her servants!"
"They say you shiver when someone walks over your grave. I feel as though something were marching back and forth across mine."
"I have seen much in my years with the Harpers, but this... this is a hollow kind of victory."
